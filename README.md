# About Word-Guess-Game

This is a hangman-style game that was coded primarily in vanilla JavaScript. The code itself is much more basic than the Trivia-Game app, which itself served as a good foundation for future apps. Simply type the letter that you want to guess and either fill the word in the given amount of attempts or lose and play again!
